1. create a variable with a word that we will guess
2. create a variable that is a list that will contain all the guessed letters
3. ask the player for a letter and store it in the list created above.
4. if the letter is in the word, print a message
5. put the letter in the list of guesses (google: python add item to list)

6. instead of having one variable to contain all guessed letters, have two: one
    for correctly gu                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        essed letters and one for incorrectly guessed letters. when
    a player guesses a letter, place it in the appropriate list.

7. repeat these steps in a loop

8. create a variable to represent the total number of wrong guesses a player is allowed
    before losing. If the number of incorrect guesses exceeds this number, print a message
    to the player that he has lost and break out of the loop
